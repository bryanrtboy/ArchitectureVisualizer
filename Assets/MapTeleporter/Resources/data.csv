3,3,Samuel Wurok and Captain Africa,Pointing to the Sky,ba3245,"186, 50, 69","My inspiration came from my childhood as a young boy, I grew up in a village that is surrounded by the mountains. I wanted to relate my building to the Rocky Mountains that we all could see when we look to the west side of Denver Colorado.",Emerald
4,4,Kellen MacDonald,TowerMac,c5a441,"197, 164, 65",This tower was inspired by the different objects formed by lofting and combining surfaces.  The building itself is formed in a very similar method.,Amber
5,5,John Riley Bonet,WhiteCap Building,48778b,"72, 119, 139","My inspiration for this building was waves in the ocean. Powerful, encapsulating, and elegant.", Sapphire

9,9,Ben Elmer,The Enveloped Core,6eaa66,"110, 170, 102", The inspiration behind this design came from a rectilinear foundation as is commonly seen throughout the Denver Metro Area.  With this foundation I wanted to implement abstract curvilinear forms and movement that made it distinctly different from other buildings seen in the Denver Skyline.,Emerald
10,10,Austin Seipel,Untitled No. 11,48778b,"72, 119, 139","My inspiration was to design a building that didn't stand out too much from afar, yet was very memorable because of its form.",Sapphire
11,11,Bayan alhouti,NAAPA,48778b,"72, 119, 139",This is modeled after the Kaliyfah Tower in Dubai. However I have made new adjustments to it.,Sapphire
12,12,Nick Calvillo,TURBO,c5a441,"197, 164, 65","The building has a center core that the rest of the structure plays off of. The form narrows incrementally as the elevation increases, creating a stepped, twisting form.",Amber
13,13,Bret Suydam- DONE,The Spike,c5a441,"197, 164, 65","The Spike is an obelisk type experiment in articulated fenestration. It appears to rise from the ground like a spike penetrating from below, rising into the sky with its barbs holding it fast into the sky.",Amber
14,14,Khalid Makkawi,The Spiral Tectonic Tower,ba3245,"186, 50, 69","It's a surreal tower with a spiral mesh-like skin that wraps around it. I designed it to be more like a sculpture and less like an actual building and therefore, the skin is intended to remain open to the outside without any glass enclosing the tower.",Ruby
16,16,Noor Alsinan,Peculiar,6eaa66,"110, 170, 102","I see my personality reflect on the building. There is this rotated tower and it is clear to people and easy to understand. The structure on the other hand of the other tower is complicated and have different materials, which I like how the both of them merge together. ",Emerald
17,17,Natasha Soltero,Mystic,6eaa66,"110, 170, 102","My inspiration was the Denver Mint which was built during the brutalist era. The building was designed to evoke the feeling of security; this was done by the idea that the people‰Ûªs money would be safe and secured in such a large and heavy set building. I took that idea and tried giving it a twist. Instead of having such a raw and bland design I took the hefty and large form but gave a unique change by exploring the outside faÌ¤ade. No one side is the same, the cap like form created has an inviting yet protective sense. I also wanted to incorporate a different kind of material, eroded copper to give it a more inviting feel.",Emerald
18,18,Donald Anderson,Verdralltbau,c5a441,"197, 164, 65","The inspiration of the building is derived from Plattenbau, which is a German brutalist type of architecture that arranges a series of identical modules to create a form. ",Amber
