# ArchitectureVisualizer

This is a Unity project for CU Denver's Design Studio 2 and Architecture collaboration. To open this project in Unity, do the following:

1. Select the Download .zip option from the green button that says 'Clone or Download'.
2. Unzip the project folder on your Mac or PC. 
3. There should be a parent folder called ArchitectureVisualizer-master with Assets as the first child. 
4. The ArchitectureVisualizer-master is the Unity project, do not move or rename the Assets folder or any other files inside unless you are doing so inside Unity.
5. Open up Unity (beta 9) and then choose to Open a New Project and select the ArchitectureVisualizer-master folder - hit open.
6. You may or may not see currently baked lighting. To bake the lighting, you need to open the Lighting panel in Unity and hit bake. Oh, and wait a couple of hours.

Enjoy!
